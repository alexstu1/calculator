# calculator
this is my first self directed project and may have bugs and vulnerabilities
this project is for leaning not making a competative program
this program is a basic calculator built in python's tkinter library

to-do list: 
  protect eval() from executing code typed into the calculator/enforce only certain charecters
  add more math to have more than one type of operation happen at once
